# Metadata fields start with an underscore (_)

# Each Kong entity (core entity or custom entity introduced by a plugin)
# can be listed in the top-level as an array of objects:

# When an entity has multiple foreign-key relationships
# (e.g. a plugin matching on both consumer and service)
# it must be specified as a top-level entity, and not through
# nesting.
